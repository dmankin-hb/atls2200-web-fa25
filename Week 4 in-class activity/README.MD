Part 1: Design System Website
Create a single-page HTML/CSS website that showcases your design system. Include:

Required Elements:

Color palette display with hex codes and contrast ratios
Typography hierarchy examples (H1-H3, body text, small text)
Spacing system demonstration
Interactive component showcase (buttons, links -- hover and visited for links)
All elements styled using your design system
Technical Requirements:

Valid HTML5 and CSS3
Accessible color contrasts (WCAG compliant)
Clean, organized code with comments
Step-by-step Instructions from class:

Step 1: Color Palette (4 minutes)

Start with one color that represents your identity/culture
Use Coolors.co to generate complementary colors
Test all color combinations for WCAG contrast compliance
Aim for 3-5 colors total (primary, secondary, accent, neutral)
Document hex codes and contrast ratios
Step 2: Typography Scale (3 minutes)

Choose 1-2 fonts from Google Fonts that reflect your aesthetic
Create hierarchy: H1, H2, H3, body text, small text
Use modular scale (e.g., 1.25x multiplier) for consistent sizing
Consider cultural associations of your font choices
Step 3: Spacing System (2 minutes)

Define 4-5 spacing values (e.g., 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px)
Base on multiples of 8 or 16 for consistency
These will control margins, padding, gaps
Step 4: Component Styles (3 minutes)

Design button styles (normal, hover, focus states)
Link styles and hover effects
Basic form input styling
Ensure all interactive elements have clear focus indicators
Part 2: Design Reflection (300-500 words)
Include a written reflection on your design system webpage addressing:

Identity & Culture:

How do your color and typography choices reflect your personal or cultural identity?
What visual elements feel most authentic to you and why?
Accessibility Considerations:

How did accessibility requirements influence your design decisions?
What challenges did you face balancing personal expression with accessibility?
Design Process:

What surprised you about creating a cohesive design system?
How will you apply this system to your portfolio project?
Future Applications:

How might you expand or refine this system for different contexts?
What aspects of your system feel most/least flexible?
