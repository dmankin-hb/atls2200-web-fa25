Overview
Building on your community research and planning from Week 5, you'll now implement CSS Grid layouts and core JavaScript functionality that genuinely serves your chosen community's needs. This assignment prioritizes meaningful interaction over technical complexityâ€”your code should empower users and solve real problems.

What You'll Submit
Updated Community Resource Website with:
CSS Grid implementation for improved content organization
Core JavaScript functionality serving community needs
Responsive design tested on community-relevant devices
Community Impact Documentation (500-750 words) reflecting on:
How your technical choices serve (or don't serve) your community
What you learned from user testing and feedback
Decisions about data, privacy, and user agency
Technical Requirements
CSS Grid Implementation
Purpose: Use Grid to improve how your community accesses and navigates information

Content-First Grid Design: Implement grid layouts that prioritize your community's information needs over aesthetic trends
Accessible Information Hierarchy: Use grid areas to create logical reading flow and clear content relationships
Responsive Community Context: Ensure layouts work well on devices your target community actually uses
Navigation Enhancement: Grid should improve, not complicate, how users move through your site
Technical Specifications:

Minimum 2 different grid layouts (e.g., homepage + resource page) -- these should be visually different from each other or any recitation demos
Use named grid areas for semantic clarity
Implement responsive behavior with grid-template-areas
Maintain accessibility with proper heading hierarchy within grid structure
JavaScript Functionality
Purpose: Code that empowers users and serves real community functions

Community-Serving Features: Implement 2-3 interactive features identified in your community research
User Agency Focus: Give people control over their experience (filtering, customization, preferences)
Progressive Enhancement: Core functionality works without JavaScript
Inclusive Interactions: Support keyboard navigation and provide clear feedback
At a minimum, your features should use querySelectors to grab elements, addEventListener to add interaction to the element, and each one should run a unique function. You should have at least two different types of interactions represented (so not all click, but perhaps click for one and some other event for another). Some examples to get you thinking about possible features are below, but you aren't expected to implement them or only adhere to them. Feel free to make some other sort of interaction.

Feature Examples (choose based on your community needs):

Search/filter system for community resources or events
Interactive forms with accessible validation and helpful error messages
Dynamic content loading for resource categories
Accessible image galleries or resource showcases
Community feedback or rating systems
Technical Specifications:

Clean, commented JavaScript code following best practices
Event listeners properly attached and removed
Error handling for user interactions
Keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements
Clear user feedback for all actions (loading states, confirmations, errors)
Testing & Iteration Requirements
Community Perspective Testing: Get feedback from at least 2 people who could be part of your target community
Accessibility Testing: Verify keyboard navigation and test with screen reader simulation
Device Testing: Test on mobile devices and slower connections
Iteration Documentation: Show what you changed based on feedback
Getting Started (In Recitation)
Step 1: Community Context Review
Review your Week 5 community research and feature planning
Identify which interactive features will have the most community impact
Consider what devices and technical contexts your community uses
Step 2: Grid Implementation
Start with your most important page (likely homepage or main resource page):

Sketch your grid layout with community information priorities in mind
Implement named grid areas that reflect content importance
Test responsive behavior immediately
Step 3: JavaScript Planning & Initial Implementation
Choose 2-3 core interactive features to start with (from example list, or think of your own)
Write pseudocode or comments outlining your approach
Begin implementing, focusing on accessibility from the start
Test each feature as you build it
Step 4: Initial Feedback
Get quick feedback from classmates from different community perspectives
Note what works and what creates barriers
Plan your post-recitation development priorities
Completing After Recitation
Technical Development
Finish implementing your core JavaScript features
Refine CSS Grid layouts based on recitation feedback
Add progressive enhancement and error handling
Conduct thorough accessibility testing
Community Testing
Test with people who represent your target community (friends, family, community members)
Ask specific questions about usability and whether features serve real needs
Document feedback and iterate based on responses
Critical Reflection
Write your Community Impact Documentation addressing:

Technical Decisions & Community Impact:

How does your grid layout serve your community's information needs?
Which JavaScript features genuinely solve community problems vs. which might be "cool but unnecessary"?
What accessibility considerations were most important for your community?
User Testing & Iteration:

What did you learn from testing with your target community?
How did feedback challenge your assumptions about "good" web design?
What would you change if you had more time/resources?
Data, Privacy & Agency:

If you're storing user data, how are you protecting privacy?
How do your interactive features give users control vs. taking it away?
What biases might be embedded in your feature choices?
Submission Details
Submit:
Link to your live website
Community Impact Documentation as PDF or markdown file
Questions to Consider While Working
Who is included or excluded by your design choices?
How does your site work for someone with slow internet or an older device?
What happens when your JavaScript fails? Do core features still work?
Would someone from your target community actually find this useful?
How are you handling user data and privacy?
Remember: The goal isn't to build the most technically impressive site, but to create something that genuinely serves your chosen community's needs while demonstrating solid technical skills and critical thinking about web development's social impact.
