Part 1: Create an Intentional Micro-interaction
Objective: Design a micro-interaction that serves a specific user experience goal while considering ethical implications.

Setup Instructions:

Open your code editor or CodePen
Create a basic HTML structure with the element you want to animate
Write CSS for your chosen micro-interaction
Choose ONE micro-interaction to create:

Option A: Persuasive Button

Create a button hover effect designed to encourage clicking
Consider: color psychology, scale changes, shadow effects
Example: Call-to-action button for newsletter signup
Option B: Attention-Guiding Form Input

Design a form input focus animation that directs user attention
Consider: border animations, label transitions, color shifts
Example: Login form or contact form field
Option C: Patient-Making Loading Animation

Build a loading animation designed to keep users waiting
Consider: smooth loops, progress indication, engaging motion
Example: Content loading spinner or progress bar
Option D: Satisfying Success Feedback

Create a "success" animation that provides rewarding feedback
Consider: celebratory effects, confirmation signals, positive reinforcement
Example: Form submission confirmation or task completion
Technical Requirements:

Use at least one CSS transition OR @keyframes animation
Include @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) with alternative styling
Implement thoughtful timing (duration between 0.2s-0.8s for most interactions)
Choose intentional easing functions (ease, ease-in-out, etc.)
Design Considerations:

Timing: How fast/slow should this feel and why?
Easing: What emotion does your easing function convey?
Purpose: What specific user behavior are you trying to encourage?
Part 2: Algorithmic Bias Analysis
Objective: Examine how algorithmic systems produce different results for different users and contexts.

Setup Instructions:

Choose ONE platform from the list below
Prepare two different browsing contexts (see options below)
Document your findings in notes or screenshots
Platform Options:

Google Search - Search for a controversial topic or current event
YouTube - Look at recommended videos on homepage or after watching a video
Instagram Explore - Compare what content appears in discovery
TikTok For You Page - Analyze the first 5-10 videos shown
Amazon Product Search - Search for the same product category
Create Two Different Contexts:

Method 1: Account Differences

Compare logged-in vs. incognito/logged-out results
OR compare two different user accounts (yours vs. friend's with permission)
Method 2: Location/Context Simulation

Use VPN to change apparent location (if available)
OR compare results at different times of day
OR compare desktop vs. mobile results
Document These Differences:

Content Ranking: What appears first vs. later in results?
Content Types: What formats/genres are prioritized? (videos vs. articles, news vs. opinion, etc.)
Perspectives: Whose voices are centered? What viewpoints dominate?
Missing Content: What do you notice is absent from each set of results?
Tone/Framing: How is the same topic presented differently?
Analysis Questions:

Who might benefit from these different algorithmic choices?
What assumptions about users seem built into each version?
How might these differences impact various communities or demographics?
What data might the algorithm be using to make these decisions?
Part 3: Post-Class Reflection Assignment
After today's exploration of micro-interactions and algorithmic systems, write a reflective essay responding to the prompts below. Use specific examples from both your hands-on work and the algorithmic analysis.

Reflection Prompts:

Technical-Ethical Connections (~150 words) Describe the micro-interaction you created and what user behavior it was designed to encourage. How did your technical choices (timing, easing, visual effects) serve that goal? Now imagine this micro-interaction within the algorithmic system you analyzedâ€”how might it contribute to the patterns of bias or manipulation you observed? Be specific about connections between your technical work and the broader systemic issues.
Power and Responsibility (~200 words) Reflect on your position as someone learning to create interactive web elements:
What power do you have as a developer to shape user behavior through design?
What responsibility comes with that power, especially toward users who may not understand how their interactions are tracked?
How do you balance creating engaging interfaces with respecting user autonomy?
Consider impacts on both individual users and communities affected by algorithmic bias.
Alternative Approaches (~150 words) Based on today's analysis, envision alternatives:
How might you design micro-interactions that serve users' genuine needs rather than engagement metrics?
Describe one specific change to either your micro-interaction or the algorithmic system you studied that would better serve user agency and community well-being.
How might developers work toward more ethical web experiences?
