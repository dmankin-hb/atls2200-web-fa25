          <p><strong>What I Extended:</strong> I changed the API from Christmas trivia to a dad joke generator using the icanhazdadjoke API. I added a loading indicator that shows while fetching jokes, a "Copy to Clipboard" button that lets users easily copy the joke, and a working Twitter share button. I also added a joke ID display to show which specific joke you received. The CSS has been completely redesigned with a new color scheme, gradient background, and improved styling with smooth transitions and hover effects.</p>
          
          <p><strong>API Use in My Critique Project:</strong> For my critique project analyzing social media's impact on mental health, I could use the Twitter API to gather real tweets about mental health topics and analyze sentiment patterns. I might also use a weather API to see if there's correlation between weather conditions and the tone of social media posts. Additionally, I could use a news API to compare social media discussions with current events coverage to see how social media amplifies or distorts news stories.</p>
