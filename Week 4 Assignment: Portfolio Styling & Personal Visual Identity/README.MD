1. Design System Implementation
Transform your HTML portfolio into a visually cohesive representation of your digital identity.

Your tasks:

Apply your chosen color palette consistently across all pages
Implement typography hierarchy using your selected fonts
Style navigation, headers, and content sections with attention to visual flow
Ensure consistency in spacing, alignment, and visual treatment across all portfolio pages
Focus on creating clear information hierarchy and optimal readability
Key considerations:

How do your visual choices reflect your personal or professional identity?
Are you maintaining sufficient contrast for accessibility?
Does your design work with varying content lengths?
2. Peer Accessibility Review & Feedback
Partner Setup
Find a partner and exchange access to your portfolios
Each person will spend equal time testing their partner's work
Accessibility Testing & Review
When reviewing your partner's portfolio, systematically evaluate:

Visual Accessibility:

Test color contrast using online contrast analyzers
Check if content remains readable when zoomed to 200%
Evaluate visual hierarchy - can you easily identify headings, navigation, and key content?
Interactive Accessibility:

Navigate the site using only your keyboard (Tab, Enter, Arrow keys)
Check that all interactive elements have visible focus states
Test that navigation is logical and predictable
Overall User Experience:

Assess readability of typography choices
Note areas where visual identity enhances or hinders usability
Consider how well the design represents the person's intended identity
Document your findings: Take notes on both strengths and areas for improvement.
